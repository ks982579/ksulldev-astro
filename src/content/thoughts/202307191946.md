description: 'Successfully deployed monday.com app today'

Today, at work, I successfully deployed an app for monday.com through AWS using the Express.js framework. Of course I had help from a colleague, and some packages, [serverless](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless) and [serverless-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http). These packages allow you to deploy an app with Express.js using AWS API Gateway and Lambda function. The benefits of doing it this way is that you only pay for what you use, and the requests made to your app. When launched in a container, the app is always listening meaning it is always running. A lambda function only executes when called, and the API Gateway is what triggers the function.

The downside is learning how to write your code so that it works more like a Lambda function than a REST API.
