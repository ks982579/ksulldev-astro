Feeling like a genius at the moment as in one afternoon, I signed my website up for the new domain name of sullivansoftware.dev, and also signed up with a new email address with that domain name through Zoho.com. I'm not a DNS records expert, but the Google IT courses I took from Coursera kind of paid off because I was able to easily follow the instructions of creating new DNS records, and understanding what I was doing (for the most part). ðŸ˜Ž
