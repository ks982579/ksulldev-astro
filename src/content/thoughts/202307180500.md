There are several types of APIs, and this [GeeksForGeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-rest-api-and-web-socket-api/) article does a good job at explaining the difference between RESTful APIs and Web Socket APIs. 

**Representational State Transfer** APIs follow the request-response communication model meaning that all communications require all necessary information to complete the request. Besides that overhead, they are easier to design and implement and "stateless", so requests are independent of each other. They are handy but because they don't provide _real-time_ communications, they cannot solve every problem.

**Web Socket** APIs allow for bi-directional, full-duplex communication. Additionally, communications first establish a connection, and then can communicate continuously. This infers a state of being connected. This allows for real-time communication and reduced overhead for messages. On the contrary, they are a bit harder to set up and can be vulnerable to security threats.
