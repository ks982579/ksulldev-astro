title: 'My Own Language?'

description: 'I have been thinking a bit about writing my own language...'

Like the description says, I've been thinking a bit lately about building my own programming language, not because the world needs another one, but for practice and to better learn the inner workings of programming. My masters program seems more focused on data science and artificial intelligence, which makes sense for being an applied sciences program. However, I do want to also learn the intricacies of computer programming. 

I'm not sure where to start, I found a couple of books, one recommended by No Starch Press, and there are online resources such as this [blog by Nora Sandler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). But I am torn between writing with Rust, which everyone keeps saying is up and coming even though the endless drama you hear about in podcasts, and good old reliable C. I also found information about having to write a virtual machine before writing the compiler to support your language.

I'll keep posting when I learn more, in between work and studying...
