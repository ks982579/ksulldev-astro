Without going back and editing the previous thought, there was a small issue. The date format, being US, wasn't a YYYYMMDD. [ISO](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ISO-date-format) is a standardized format for expressing dates. Believe it or not, this is a better solution:

```js
let today = (new Date()).toISOString().split('.')[0].replace(/[^\d]/g, '');
console.log(today)
```

It'll produce the following. Do note that this is UTC time, part of the standard. 

```shell
"20230620093429"
```

Well, it will produce different results based on when you run it ðŸ˜….
