Getting a component to fade into view via CSS and JavaScript isn't too complicated once you understand the basics. Here's a couple of web articles for some help:
+ [dev.to/how-to-fade-in-content](https://dev.to/selbekk/how-to-fade-in-content-as-it-scrolls-into-view-10j4)
+ [blog.hubspot.com](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-fade-in)
+ [MDN/getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect)

Now, in Astro, you have to be conscious of where you put your CSS because if you place it in a component file Astro treats it automatically like a module. That makes referencing its name practically impossible. I places the CSS in a "./src/styles/global.scss" file.

```scss
.fade-in-section {
    opacity: 0;
    position: relative;
    top: 1.25rem;
    transition: top 0.5s ease-in, opacity 0.5s ease-out;
}

.fade-in-section.is-visible {
    opacity: 1;
    top: 0;
}
```

Now, you can put the class on your components. It might help for a list of components to use the `.map()` method so Astro will apply them for you with less writing. I places the JavaScript to add the `.is-visible` class within the Astro component, in a `<script>` tag.

```js
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.fade-in-section');

    function fadeInElements() {
        elements.forEach((element) => {
            const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
            const isVisible = (rect.top - 15) < window.innerHeight && rect.bottom >= 10;
            if (isVisible) {
                element.classList.add('is-visible');
            } else {
                element.classList.remove('is-visible');
            }
        });
    }

    window.addEventListener('scroll', fadeInElements);
    window.addEventListener('resize', fadeInElements);
    fadeInElements(); // Initial check on page load
```

This grabs every component with the initial `.fade-in-section` class and runs the `fadeInElements()` function when the window is scrolled or resized. Read up the MDN article on `getBoundingClientRect()`, it's a handy method. The custom function adds and removes the `.is-visible` class based on the element's position on the screen. Personally, I removed the `rect.bottom >= 10` because I didn't want to fade in while scrolling up, but the choice is yours. 

Since React uses the virtual DOM, you could probably do something similar using `Ref`'s. However, it is a big no-no to alter DOM elements directly in React. Basically, you don't want to make changes to elements that React isn't aware of. So, pull the information about the component you need and then make the changes on the component, not the DOM element.

Hope this was helpful, probably will be for future me :)
