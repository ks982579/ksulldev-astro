Keeping up with programming and learning for the Masters isn't easy. In fact, it's quite difficult even doing it part-time. I took the maths exam over the weekend. I studied my tail off, reviewing calculus, integral transformations, convolutions, Fourier series and transform, $\vec{v}$ector algebra and calculus, linear and matrix algebra, and some information theory topics such as Shannon and cross entropy. 

All of those hours of reviewing note and practice problems... and I think I over studied. I haven't gotten the grade back yet but I completed the 90 minute long test in just over 30 and spent another 20 minutes reviewing my work. I am prone to small errors, but I think it went pretty well ðŸ˜Ž. Now on to learning Data Science!
