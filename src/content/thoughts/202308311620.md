I'm a huge fan of the YouTube channel Fireship, who released an interesting video, ["The ruthless forking of Terraform"](https://youtu.be/HzBA6FIn_Bo?si=dU_OPMnCHQX1_HUQ). Basically, HashiCorp, owners of Terraform and other products, are changing their coding licences for a more profitable vernture. However, there's a fork of it that is remaining completely opensource called [OpenTF](https://opentf.org/announcement). More information is found in the link. We are also encouraged to start their [Github repo](https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto) to give them support. Long live opensource!
