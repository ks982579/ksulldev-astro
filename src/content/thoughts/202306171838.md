Spent 6 hours working on a Scrum presentation for my Master's today... still not complete. Nearly there but I only have 15 minutes to give it and let's just say I have to cut out a lot of work I did earlier to answer all of the questions in time.

Point being, I would have much rather spent 6 hours in my Machine Learning Udemy course.
