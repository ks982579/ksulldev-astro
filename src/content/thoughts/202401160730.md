description: 'Why do companies say they are remote when they are actually hybrid?'

Many companies say they are remote when they clearly are not remote companies. Or, even if you require some office staff, maybe to maintain servers or work in a laboratory, you can still have pure remote roles. So I wanted to just clarify what it should mean to be remote, or at least to me. 

If the business requires an employee to come to an office location to work, on any sort of recurrent basis, whether it be weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc... that is a **hybrid** position. A **remote** position, and therefore a remote company, does not force employees into an office to do work, especially work that can be done from home. 

I can draw a comparison between this and dietary preferences. If you are vegan, then you do not consume animal products. If you eat dairy, eggs, meat, or other foods that come from animals, you don't say, "I'm vegan but I eat cheese." A word for that already exists, and it is _vegetarian_. Same goes for hybrid companies that claim to be remote. You cannot correctly say, "This is a remote company, but we mandate employees to come into office once a week." A word exists for that, and it is _hybrid_.
