description: 'What's the difference between the GPU and CPU?'

I accidently clicked on a YouTube video and watched a good chuck of it that tested speeds of CPUs vs. GPUs for certain tasks. That got me a little curious, so I did some digging. 

[HowStuffWorks.com](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/graphics-card.htm) covers how a screen can have millions of pixels and how a GPU is needed to render complex images. A graphics card typically has a Graphics Processor (GPU) and some Video Memory (VRAM). They perform complex maths and geometry calculations to render graphics. But the information left me wondering about why they perform better with graphics than a CPU.

[TechTarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/definition/GPU-graphics-processing-unit/) has similar information but dives a little into the history before GPUs were all the buzz. They also discuss that GPUs are designed for "data-parallelism", applying the same instruction to muliple data-itmes. On the other hand, CPUs are designed for task-parallelism, which is like doing different things to different... things. CPUs usually have 4-8 cores, some have 32, and AMD Ryzen Threadripper has 64 cores. A big difference is that some CPUs have multithreading capabilities, typically 2 cores per thread. But a GPU can have 4-10 threads per core. But how many cores does a GPU have?

Right into the belly of the beast, diving into this 2009 [Nvidia blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/), a GPU can have **hundreds of cores** that handle thousands of threads simultaneously.

So, they may lack the power to handle large complex tasks, but GPUs make up for it by doing one easier thing very quickly and in parallel thousands of times over. Along with the AI boom, and a quick look on Google, there are other chips like the Neural Processing Unit (NPU), and the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). According to this [bizety.com](https://www.bizety.com/2023/01/03/ai-chips-npu-vs-tpu/) article, TPUs are more specifically designed for deep learning, whilst NPUs are a generalist for the broader machine learning algorithms. Also, TPUs are made by Google and only avaiable through them via their cloud. NPUs can be developed and used by any company.
