Nvidia has long been the major graphics card manufacturer, with AMD taking a small slice of the pie. And since graphics cards are used to build many AI models, they've been partially responsible for driving the AI revolution as well. 

Google has their own Tensor Processor Unit chips to power their AI journey, relieving them from Nvidia's monopolistic grip on the market, but what about OpenAI? It is expected that at Microsoft's developer conference in November, called _Ignite_, they may announce [their first AI chip](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-may-debut-its-first-ai-chip-at-ignite-2023-to-mitigate-cost?utm_source=sullivansoftware). Additionally, [OpenAI is considering developing their own AI Chips](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/openai-said-to-be-considering-developing-its-own-ai-chips/?utm_source=sullivansoftware). This is because Nvidia is sold out until mid 2024, and other chip makers like Graphcore are fighting through challenging times, having to make job cuts to survi... make more money.
