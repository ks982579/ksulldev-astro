Today's thought is brought to you by phind.com. It's an AI search engine made for developers. I'm currently going through a maths course for the Master's degree and trying to write nice notes. But how do you write them in markdown?

I'm hoping this works, but with the `\begin{aligned}` and `\end{aligned}` commands, and then the `&=` with the `\\` to create newlines, we get 

```markdown
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_a^bf(x)dx &=\int_{x_0}^bf(x)dx-\int_{x_0}^{a}f(x)dx\\
&= F(b)-F(a)
\end{aligned}
$$
```

Which, with any luck looks like this...
$$
\begin{gather}
\int_a^bf(x)dx &=\int_{x_0}^bf(x)dx-\int_{x_0}^{a}f(x)dx\\
&= F(b)-F(a)
\end{gather}
$$

Well, it's not lined up nicely on my website, but lines up nice in the Obsidian markdown editor.
