Here's the first thought for my website. It's a markdown file. The idea is to quickly create the markdown file if I have a thought and push live, keeping the website (and my GitHub) looking active!

So, you can apparently use [Astro collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#what-are-content-collections) to do something similar to what these thoughts are, but I don't think I am going to use that just yet.
