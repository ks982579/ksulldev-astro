This is a large book, over 800 pages, and the last for my Data Science course. If you are interested in reading yourself, you can get a nice pdf from [eBooks.com](https://www.ebooks.com/en-ie/book/210681725/hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-keras-and-tensorflow/aur-lien-g-ron/). I would love to do an extensive deep dive into this book, especially the Reinforcement Learning section, but I don't think it's possible right now.
