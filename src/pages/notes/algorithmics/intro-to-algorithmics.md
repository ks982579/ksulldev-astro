# Course Learning Objectives

This course suggests several books for reading

- [ ] Introduction to Algorithms; MIT Press
- [ ] The New Turning Omnibus, MacMillan Education
- [ ] Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing; Springer
	- [ ] [Sprinter Website](https://link.springer.com/book/9783642272653) soft and hardcover books - expensive enough
- [ ] Algorithms; Pearson Education; Sedgewick, A., & Wayne, K.
	- [ ] [For Free!!!](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) but only online
- [ ] The Algorithm Design Manual; Springer
- [ ] The Power of Algorithms; Springer

It would be difficult to read them all with probably a big overlap of material. Apparently the first is quite good. I am reading The Algorithm Design Manual which is also good so far.

**Algorithmics** aims to discuss the historical and theoretical foundations of computer science and explore key concepts on the design and programming of algorithms. Another interesting concept are the societal implications of the use of the computer applications, which come from programming algorithms. We are all aware of the 2000s dot-com bubble and the 2022 AI Hype train. We may also investigate some futuristic paradigms of algorithms. 

# Unit 1: Introduction to Algorithmics

pp. 15-32

Our learning objectives are as follows:
+ Basic concepts of algorithmics.
+ Key issues in the algorithm quality and the difficulty levels of computational problems.
+ Important features of the interplay between algorithms, programming languages, and data structures using Rust programming language.
	+ The course actually uses the JavaScript programming language.
+ Historical and Contemporary role of algorithmics.
