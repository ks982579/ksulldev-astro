# Algorithm Design

pp. 34-70

Our learning objectives are as follows:
+ How to organize the data of your algorithms into suitable data structures.
+ The user of iteration and recursion in algorithm design.
+ Key algorithm design strategies.

## Introduction

You will eventually need to create an algorithm for a computational problem in the field of computer science. It is handy to know of existing algorithm design techniques to draw inspiration from. It's also important to have experience with other computational problems to find similarities and differences between various computational problems. Because some differences come from the nature of the underlying data, an understanding of different data structures is also critical in design. 

## 2.1 Data Structures

pp. 34-59

As stated above, algorithms use different data structures, which may represent different data. What is a data structure? A **Data Structure** organizes data into a suitable format that allows an algorithm to apply operations to it. Examples include arrays, lists, heaps, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs. 

### Arrays

We said an array is an example of a data structure, but what is it? You can read up on [array (data structure) | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)) for more information. But, an **Array** is a finite collection of elements, each taking up the same amount of space in memory and identified by at least one array index, or key.
