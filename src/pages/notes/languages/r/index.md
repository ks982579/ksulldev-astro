# Beginning Data Science in R 4

> Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modelling for the Data Scientist, 2nd edition

These are just notes from the book. The read is encouraged to read the book in its entirety. 

As a new R programmer, I'll try to keep track of helpful websites:
+ https://r-coder.com/rstudio-themes/
## Ch. 1 - Introduction to R Programming

> pp. 1 - 50

Download R and RStudio.

I downloaded R from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and am trying to use in Visual Studio Code with the `REditorSupport` extension. Seems to be OK. 

I think recently RStudio has moved to https://posit.co/. Interestingly, they also seem to be owners of Shiny and Quarto. 

### Basics

You can also find manuals for R on their official website, [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

The book starts with basic calculator like calculations. Numbers in R are all floats, just a default. To get a pure integer, append with the `L` postfix.

```r
class(42)
## [1] "numeric"
class(42L)
## [1] "integer"
```

In many languages, the `%` is the modulus operator, returning the remainder of division. Because the percent-sign has a different meaning in R, use `%%` for the modulus. And integer division is `%/%`. 

```r
6/4
## [1] 1.5
6%%4 
## [1] 2
6%/%4
## [1] 1
```

I was a little confused until I played around, not remembering definitions. Hopefully the example clears up difference between returning the remainder component of division, and the integer component of division. 

Exponents can use either `^` or `**`. 

Strings use either double of single quotes. 

Assignments to variables use _arrow_ operators. You can assign both ways, not typical of a language. 

```r
x <- 2
4 -> y
y * 10 + x
## [1] 42
```

In the terminal, assignment is _silent_, it won't print results. If you wrap that shit in parenthesis, it will print the result of the assignment. 

Convention for notes is writing output with 2 pound-signs. But notice the `[1]`. This just tells you what index of a vector you are looking at in the first place of that line. Check out `1:500` in your terminal. Oh, and the colon creates a sequence. This creates sequence that is also inclusive of both arguments. 

Use `seq(start, stop, inc)` to increment sequence by other than one. Also, vectors are 1 indexed, not 0 indexed like most other programming languages. 

Use `length(var)` to get length of vector. Note, if you get length of string, it will just tell you 1 because it's one element in a vector. You must `nchar("Hello, world!")` for number of characters.

```r
("Hello, world!" -> phrase)
## [1] "Hello, world!"
(c(7,23,24) -> vec)
## [1]  7 23 24
length(phrase)
## [1] 1
length(vec)
## [1] 3
nchar(phrase)
## [1] 13
nchar(vec)
## [1] 1 2 2
nchar(42.0000)
## [1] 2
```

Funny how `nchar()` will count number of digits for numbers, but only necessary digits, clever. 

To concatenate strings, use `paste("string 1", "string 2", sep=", ")`. Default separator is just a space. 

You index a vector with square brackets, like _Python_ ðŸ™Š. Again, this is a 1 indexed language, not 0 indexed. You can extract a sequence of values, using either the `:` operator or the `c()` concatenate function. Both apply a mask that extract only the index requested. Suppose then you can use the `seq()` function as well. 

You could also use a vector of Boolean values, and R will only return the `TRUE` values. Yes, all-caps for Boolean keywords. 

```r
(taco <- seq(1,25,3))
## [1]  1  4  7 10 13 16 19 22 25
taco %% 4
## [1] 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 1
taco %% 4 == 0
## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
taco[taco %% 4 == 0]    
## [1]  4 16
```

You can also get **complement** with `vec[-(1:3)]`, meaning it returns all index values not in `1:3`. 

Here's also an interesting concept, that of an object or dictionary. 

```r
vec <- c("A" = 1, "B" = 2) 
vec[1]
## A
## 1
vec["A"]
## A
## 1

c(6,7,42) -> t
(names(t) <- c("x", "y", "z"))
## x  y  z
## 6  7 42
```

This is a handy mapping feature for tables, and the `names()` function seems to help with assignment, almost like zipping two vectors together. 

You can declare multiple variables in one line if separated with the `;` semicolon. 

### Vectorized Expressions

In $\huge{\mathscr{R}}$, arithmetic expressions work component-wise on vectors. This has weird consequence when vectors are different lengths. R will repeat the shorter vectors until your expression has cycled through every element of the longest vector. 

### Functions

Firstly, comments begin with `#` pound sign. 

When passing arguments into a function, you can do so implicitly or explicitly if you know parameter names. Similar to Python, order matters for implicit assignment, and not for explicit. Ok to combine but cannot pass implicit after explicit. 

In the R terminal, if you want information on a function, use the `?` operator

```r
?length
?`+`
```

It sent me to the documentation webpage at `127:0:0:1`, which is localhost. Apparently for RStudio, it's more inclusive. Use the back-ticks for operators. 

To write your own function, use the `function()` keyword and assign it to a variable name... That's a little weird. 

```r
sqr <- function(x) x^2
distance <- function(x, y, z) {
	c <- sum(sqr(x), sqr(y), z^2)
	c^(1/2)
}
```

Note, you can write functions in one line, a bit like JavaScript. Or, you can create a function _body_ with curly-brackets. The function `sum()` is predefined by R.

The example shows an implicit return. You can be explicit with the return value, but that is another function, `return()`. Most languages have a keyword, but not in R. 

Keep in mind that what can be passed into a function is a vector. Thus, if you condense the values, with a sum or average, you will obtain a summary statistic, a vector with a different length. 

```r
average <- function(x) sum(x) / length(x)
```

R comes with `mean()` which is more robust, handling missing data and vectors of length zero. 

A fun idea is returning multiple values.

```r
mean_and_sd <- function(y) c(mean = mean(y), sd = sd(y))
```

There are also `var()`, `cov()`, and `cor()` for the variance, covariance, and correlation. Use `?` to read more.
