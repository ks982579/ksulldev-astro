# Beginning Data Science in R 4

> Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modelling for the Data Scientist, 2nd edition

These are just notes from the book. The read is encouraged to read the book in its entirety. 

As a new R programmer, I'll try to keep track of helpful websites:

## Ch. 1 - Introduction to R Programming

> pp. 1 - 50

Download R and RStudio.

I downloaded R from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and am trying to use in Visual Studio Code with the `REditorSupport` extension. Seems to be OK. 

I think recently RStudio has moved to https://posit.co/. Interestingly, they also seem to be owners of Shiny and Quarto. 

### Basics

You can also find manuals for R on their official website, [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

The book starts with basic calculator like calculations. Numbers in R are all floats, just a default. To get a pure integer, append with the `L` postfix.

```r
class(42)
## [1] "numeric"
class(42L)
## [1] "integer"
```

In many languages, the `%` is the modulus operator, returning the remainder of division. Because the percent-sign has a different meaning in R, use `%%` for the modulus. And integer division is `%/%`. 

```r
6/4
## [1] 1.5
6%%4 
## [1] 2
6%/%4
## [1] 1
```

I was a little confused until I played around, not remembering definitions. Hopefully the example clears up difference between returning the remainder component of division, and the integer component of division. 

Exponents can use either `^` or `**`. 

Strings use either double of single quotes. 

Assignments to variables use _arrow_ operators. You can assign both ways, not typical of a language. 

```r
x <- 2
4 -> y
y * 10 + x
## [1] 42
```

In the terminal, assignment is _silent_, it won't print results. If you wrap that shit in parenthesis, it will print the result of the assignment. 

Convention for notes is writing output with 2 pound-signs. But notice the `[1]`. This just tells you what index of a vector you are looking at in the first place of that line. Check out `1:500` in your terminal. Oh, and the colon creates a sequence. This creates sequence that is also inclusive of both arguments. 

Use `seq(start, stop, inc)` to increment sequence by other than one. Also, vectors are 1 indexed, not 0 indexed like most other programming languages. 

Use `length(var)` to get length of vector. Note, if you get length of string, it will just tell you 1 because it's one element in a vector. You must `nchar("Hello, world!")` for number of characters.

```r
("Hello, world!" -> phrase)
## [1] "Hello, world!"
(c(7,23,24) -> vec)
## [1]  7 23 24
length(phrase)
## [1] 1
length(vec)
## [1] 3
nchar(phrase)
## [1] 13
nchar(vec)
## [1] 1 2 2
nchar(42.0000)
## [1] 2
```

Funny how `nchar()` will count number of digits for numbers, but only necessary digits, clever. 

To concatenate strings, use `paste("string 1", "string 2", sep=", ")`. Default separator is just a space. 

You index a vector with square brackets, like _Python_ ðŸ™Š. Again, this is a 1 indexed language, not 0 indexed. You can extract a sequence of values, using either the `:` operator or the `c()` concatenate function. Both apply a mask that extract only the index requested. Suppose then you can use the `seq()` function as well. 

You could also use a vector of Boolean values, and R will only return the `TRUE` values. Yes, all-caps for Boolean keywords. 

```r
(taco <- seq(1,25,3))
## [1]  1  4  7 10 13 16 19 22 25
taco %% 4
## [1] 1 0 3 2 1 0 3 2 1
taco %% 4 == 0
## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
taco[taco %% 4 == 0]    
## [1]  4 16
```

You can also get **complement** with `vec[-(1:3)]`, meaning it returns all index values not in `1:3`. 

Here's also an interesting concept, that of an object or dictionary. 

```r
vec <- c("A" = 1, "B" = 2) 
vec[1]
## A
## 1
vec["A"]
## A
## 1

c(6,7,42) -> t
(names(t) <- c("x", "y", "z"))
## x  y  z
## 6  7 42
```

This is a handy mapping feature for tables, and the `names()` function seems to help with assignment, almost like zipping two vectors together. 

You can declare multiple variables in one line if separated with the `;` semicolon.
