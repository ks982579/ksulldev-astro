## Introduction 

Statistics as a science is the science of collecting, presenting, analysing, and interpreting facts and data. This sounds a bit like Data Science.

Statistics can also be the plural for statistic, which is a single measure of a sample. More about this later. 

What are the two main branches that Statistics as a science are commonly subdivided into?
+ Descriptive Statistics
	+ Comprised of presenting and analysing observed data. 
	+ This statistics strictly limits itself to data collected from a specific group of observed units (such as people).
	+ Not assumed that data come from a larger population, nor is any inference made about non-observed data.
+ Inferential Statistics
	+ Data from a subset of a population (aka sample) is used to estimate corresponding data of a larger population using statistical methods. 
	+ Estimates take the form of points or intervals.
