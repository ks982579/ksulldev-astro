# Unit 6: Parameter Estimation

pp. 145 - 180

Our learning objectives are as follows:
+ Find maximum likelihood estimates by directly maximizing the log-likelihood function and the ordinary least squares (OLS) approach to parameter estimation.
+ Define the OLS cost function and understand how OLS is implemented to find parameter estimates for linear regression.
+ Use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.
+ Understand Gaussian mixture models and how the EM algorithm is applied to estimate its parameters with incomplete data.
+ Analyse the role regularization plays in parameter estimation, including how ridge and lasso perform regularization, and the specific penalty terms they add to the cost function. 
+ Understand how uncertainties are encoded for a vector of random variables.
+ Compute the uncertainties of the transformation (linear and non-linear) of a vector of random variables.
