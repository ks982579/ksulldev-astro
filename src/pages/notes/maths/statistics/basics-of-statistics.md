As a note, some good books (besides this) that I have and would like to read are:
+ Introduction to Mathematical Statistics
+ Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
+ Mathematics for Machine Learning
+ Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms

This is additional reading for my Advanced Statistics course to get students up-to-speed depending on their background. I may take brief notes here for myself but point any avid readers to the source text.
