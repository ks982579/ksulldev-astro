		<h2>SullivanSoftware.dev - About</h2>
		<article class="selector">
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>Who is this?</h4>
				<p>
					My name is Kevin Sullivan, former Actuary and current Software Engineer.
					With a foundation in actuarial mathematics and economics, 
					I have evolved through role in rull-stack development and test automation to
					my current position building security solutions at Forcepoint.
					Currently pursuing an MSc. in Computer Science,
					I combine my analytical background with software engineeringg expertise to create robust
					systems that protect and enhance people's digital lives.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>What do you do?</h4>
				<p>
					I architect and develop security software solutions,
					specializing in browser extensions and systems programming.
					Working across the full technology stack,
					I build robust applications using C++, JavaScript, Python, and React.
					I'm particularly passionate about systems programming and have recently 
					explored Rust for web development projects.
					My work focuses on creating secure, efficient software that bridges web broswers
					and operating systems to protect user data.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>Where do you do it?</h4>
				<p>
					I live in beautiful county Cork, Ireland. I am currently
					pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science with the International
					University of Applied Sciences. I have experience working
					remotely and prefer the flexibility and benefits of working
					from home.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>When did you start?</h4>
				<p>
					My journey with programming began in academia,
					first with C++ at Onondaga Community College in 2009
					and later Java at the University at Albany in 2012.
					While I initially pursued a career in actuarial science, 
					my passion for programming never faded.
					In 2020, as a Business Data Technician, I began developing internal tools
					with Python and JavaScript to automate workflows and enhance team productivity.
					This hands-on development experience reignited my programming ambition,
					leading me to transition fully into software engineering in 2022
					at Nuritas as a full-stack developer.
					From there, I moved into test automation at Forcepoint in 2023, and have since
					advanced to a Software Engineer role focusing on security and systems programming.
					Alongside this professional evolution,
					I began pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science in 2023,
					continuously expanding my expertise in software development.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>Why do you do it?</h4>
				<p>
					I am driven by the challenge of solving complex technical problems across the full software stack.
					As a neurodivergent engineer, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and thrive
					in environments that allow for deep technical focus and creative solutions.
					My passion lies in creating efficient, robust software that makes a meaningful impact,
					whether that is building intuitive web applications,
					developing system-level components, or implementing security featrues.
					I excel in remote work environments that enable me to leverage my natual abilities
					for sustained concentration and detailed analysis while maintaining the work-life balance
					needed for continuous learning and growth.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-bubble fade-in-section">
				<h4>How do you do it?</h4>
				<p>
					I leverage a comprehensive technical toolkit that spans multiple layers of the software stack.
					At the systems level, I work with C++ and Rust to build performant, secure components.
					For web interfaces, I develop with JavaScript and React, creating seamless user experiences.
					My background in Python serves me well in automation and backend development,
					while my actuarial training brings a rigorous analytical approach to problem-solving.
					I embrace test-driven development and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines,
					using tools like Jenkins and Docker to ensure consisten delivery.
					Whether I am architecting browser extensions,
					implementing system-level security features,
					or designing cross-platform solutions,
					I combine careful technical design with agile methodologies
					to create maintainable, secure software that stands the test of time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I would also like to give a very special shout-out to my amazing
					wife Lisa, for all of her love and support, and without whom
					none of this would be possible.
